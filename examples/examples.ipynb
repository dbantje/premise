    "\n",
    "This library extract useful information from IAM model output files (such as those of REMIND or IMAGE) and aligns inventories in the ecoinvent database accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With version 1.5.0, the following transformation are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `update(\"biomass\")`: creates regional biomass markets, adjusting the share of residual vs. purpose-grown boimass for use in heat and power generation\n",
    "* `update(\"battery\")`: creates a global mix for stationary and mobile battery technologies.\n",
    "* `update(\"electricity\")`: creates regional electricity markets and adjust efficiency of power plants, including that of photovoltaic panels\n",
    "* `update(\"cement\")`: creates regional markets for clinker production and adjust clinker production efficiency\n",
    "* `update(\"steel\")`: creates regional markets for steel and adjust steel production efficiency and the supply of secondary steel\n",
    "* `update(\"dac\")`: creates region- and scenario-specific inventories for Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Storage (DACCS) systems.\n",
    "* `update(\"fuels\")`: creates regional markets for liquid and gaseous fuels\n",
    "* `update(\"heat\")`: regionalizes some heat and steam generation datasets (working on diesel, biomass and natural gas)\n",
    "* `update(\"emissions\")`: adjusts emission of pollutants (PM, NOx, VOCs) for various activities, based on GAINS model projections.\n",
    "* `update(\"two_wheelers\")`: imports two-wheelers (bicycles, motorbikes, etc.)\n",
    "* `update(\"cars\")`: produces fleet average cars and relinks to activities consuming pasenger car transport\n",
    "* `update(\"trucks\")`: produces fleet average trucks and relinks to activities consuming lorry transport\n",
    "* `update(\"buses\")`: imports buses (urban and coach buses, single-deckers and double-deckers)\n",
    "* `update(\"trains\")`: imports buses (urban and coach buses, single-deckers and double-deckers)\n",
    "* `update(\"external\")`: runs any external scenarios provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, `update()` performs all the above-mentioned transformations.\n",
